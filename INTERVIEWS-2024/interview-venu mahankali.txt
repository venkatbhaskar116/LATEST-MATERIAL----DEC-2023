Q.how to reduce the runtime of jenkins declarative pipeline----
using parallelism and metrics combinations.[add stages----stage--("paralle stage")---below parallel----'stage task 1'
using UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM JOBS---means once a job completes it triggers automatically the next job.
u can use the shared library to get the code and use in multiple pipelines by the reusability.
ckeck in CHATGPT------

Q.benefits of SHARED LIBRARY----
1.Reusabililty-----Shared libraries allow you to write code once and use across multiple jenkins pipelines reducing duplication and ensuring
  consistancy.
2.MAINTANABILITY---Centralizing your common scripts and resources in shared library makes it easier to manage and update them as needed.

Q.explain the declarative pipeline and scripted pipeline-------------
DECLARATIVE PIPELINE------                         
pipeline {                                         
agent any {                      
stages
   stage ('Build')
      steps
In declarative, u can not run the pipeline if anystage fails in between-u should fix that stage and then pipeline executes .quick problem fixing possible.
U can restart any specific stage in declarative.
pipeline sysntax
In Scripted it will continue execution of pipeline until all stages,even a stage fails it continues to execute pipeline.u can not use specific stage
to restart or bug fix in scripted.
node syntax

SCRIPTED PIPELINE------
node {
    stage ('Build') {

}
   stage ('Test') {

}
   stage ('Deploy') {

}


Q.how to identify the public or private subnet in aws-------
A public subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that has a route to an Internet gateway. This connects the VPC to the Internet 
and to other AWS services. 
A private subnet is a subnet that is associated with a route table that doesn't have a route to an internet gateway.

Q.W.R.T to terraform statefile?what if statefile missing?--12th min
Terraform statefile contains the resources to be create,it stores in in local backend(tf.state file) and also stored in remote backend(s3 etc).
we can get the tf statefile from remote backend incase of missing.	

Q.explain DOCKERFILE?

Q.DOCKER SWARM?

Q.Why pod is restarting alwways?
u can use the policy, restart=never to stop restarting in pod definition file.
                      restart=always restart always

Q.how  to create persistant volume in k8s?
in volume yaml file

Q.how to limit the access to a namespace?
using RBAC---
ROLE AND ROLE BINDING  bound to a namespace
CLUSTER ROLE AND CLUSTER ROLE BINDING ARE AT CLUSTER LEVEL.

Q.Container crashloopbackoff error------
generally a container in a pod starts,crashes and restart repeatedly
by default pod restart policy is always.
kubectl get pods ---will give the output as image,status and restarts.
common causes-------
insufficient resources--
lockedfile---------a file is already locked by another container
locked database---a db is used and locked by other pods.
missing dependencies
kubectl describe pod podname
kubectl logs -f podname -n namespacename
kubectl logs -f podname -c container name
kubectl get events
kubectl describe deployment deployment name
check for resource limits in manifestfile
