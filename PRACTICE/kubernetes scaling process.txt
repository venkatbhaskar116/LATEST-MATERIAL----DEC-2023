pavan elthepu-----------Autoscaling in Kubernetes--------https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyBDbm1FHiM

HORIZONTAL AUTOSCALING----------increases number of pods(replicas) as load or requests are increased.Increasing the number of pods is also called SCALEUP[scalingup]
BACKGROUND-----------------FOR CLUSTER U WILL HAVE master node and worker node.In workernode u will have a kubelet,in kubelet u will have an agent "cAdvisor"[container
advisor]--which collect the metrics like cpu and memory for every 10 seconds.For every minute the metric server in masternode will aggregate and expose those metrics
with k8s API server.
HPA(horizontal pod autoscaler)querries the API serrver  for eery 15 seconds for these metrics,once HPAcontroller gets these desired metrics it checks these metrics
against our definition and then decides to scaleup or scaledown our replicas.
HPAcontroller  just updates the replca count in the traget deployment,spinnigup a new pod or deleting the existing pod will be taken care by the replication controller.
And cAdvisor statrts collecting the new pod metrics aswell.
in deployment.yaml file min replicas(1) and max replicas(5)for example,morethan average utilization 70% scaleup.lessthan 50% scaledown as per.
service.yaml 
hpa.yaml


VERTICAL SCALING----------------INCREASES the resources like cpu,memory instead of pods increasing.
CLUSTER AUTOSCALING-------------As needed add the no of nodes to the cluster to automatically accomodate more no of pods,cluster autoscaler will do that.
                                It adds the nodes to the cluster if there are any pods struck in pending state because of lack of resources in the cluster,

YOU CAN ALSO DECREASING THE BY SCALEDOWN ----decreasing the no od pods(HA),decrese the resources like cpu and memory(VA)) and finally minimise the no of nodes in cluster
                                             depends of load requirements.

IN cluster autoscaler---insuuficient resources
if pod requests for 1 cpu,if cluster does not containe that(like it has .5 cpu)the scheduler marks that pod as unscheduled.
1.freeup the resources in cluster by deleting the unwanted workloads
2.manually adding the new nodes
3.let k8s dealing with adding nodes automatically whenver there is a need
IN CLUSTER AUTOSCALER---CA looks for any unscheduled pods,then CA will create new node and scheduler will schedule that pod(CA doesnot look for cpu,memory)
INCASE OF aws---CA will provision new EC2 instance
          azure--virtual machine
          GCP----compute engine
