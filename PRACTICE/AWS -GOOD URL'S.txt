What happens to running pods if if you stop Kubelet on the worker nodes?
What happens if Kubelet goes down?
If the kubelet crashes or stops on a node, it cannot communicate with the API server and the node goes into a not ready state. Run kubectl describe node [name] and 
look in the Conditions sectionâ€”if all the conditions are unknown, this indicates the kubelet is down.

What is the impact of upgrading kubelet if we leave pods on the worker node?
Restarting kubelet, which has to happen for an upgrade will cause all the Pods on the node to stop and be started again.
