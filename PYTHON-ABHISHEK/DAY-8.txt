
LIST IS MUTABLE and in square brackets[]
Tuple is immutable(not changable or resized)) .used normal braces(brackets)-------ex ()
s3_buckets_list.append(new bucket name)---to add or change the object in the list
                remove                 ---to remove or change the object in the list

IF U WANT TO SELECT ANY SPECIFIC ELEMENT FROM THE LIST USE indexes(because list is using indexing)
suppose if u wwant select first element in the list
print s3_buckets_lists[0]-----indexing starts from 0 for first element and so on.
                      [1]---- select the second element
                      [2]----selects the third element

LENGTH OF THE LIST------print(len(s3_bucket_lists))
INTERVIEW------------lists are heterogenious in nature.means that u can store any data type in the list (ex---1,2,3,bachi,tim)
