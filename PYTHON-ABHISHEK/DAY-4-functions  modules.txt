ABHISHEK-PYTHON    DAY-4    

FUNCTION----------calculator.py file
A function is defined to execute the task as below.

def (definition) [keyword]  addition(function name) ():
    addition = (variable1 + variable2)
    print (add)----------like this --for addition one funtion and for substraction one function etc
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if a = 10--------------variables
   b = 5
def addition():
    add = a = b
    print(add

def sub():
    sub = a -b 
    print(add)


def mul():
    mul = a * b
    print(mul)

addition()
sub()
mul()------------------execute(python calculator.py(filename)
IMP----after writing the function-- u need to explicitly invoke(call) the function at the end(like addition,sub,mul and div).

With FUNCTIONS---
1.Readability----when u send the code for review(after making changes) he can easily find if there is any bug etc..
2.Re-Usability(modularity)--
3.Debugging-------easy to identify
practice for s3,ec2 or for creating jira ticket in python like addition,sub as above

MODULES-------------
                    Modules are simply group of functions.it is reusable for many teams or projects by modifying any function(part of module) or complete module.
for example u have calculator file and other team wants to write a file with advance features,that team can use this file.
create a file adv-cal.py-----
import calculator(previous file name) as basic_calc

basic_calc(execute it----u will get o/p as previous calculator file)check in codespace[BACHIcodespace]
u can import single function or multiple(like addition only)
u can replace the print with return -----as velow

def (definition) [keyword]  addition(function name) ():
    addition = (variable1 + variable2)
    print (add)----------like this --for addition one funtion and for substraction one function etc
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if a = 10--------------check in calculator.py for changes 
   b = 5
def addition(num1,num2):
    add = a + b
    return add

def sub(num1,num2):
    sub = a - b 
    return sub


def mul(num1,num2):
    mul = a * b
    return mul

print (addition(10,5))
print (sub(10,5))
print (mul(10,5))--------------45 min complete

PACKAGES-------------------
              IS COLLECTION OF MODULES--
aws----boto3------module name of aws
github-----github--module name of github
jira---jira--module name for jira

u can search for PACKAGES in pypi(python project index) like an dockerhub(in google---pypi---search for any package)-----53min
to know which packages are installed ------------pip list


VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT--------Creating virtual environment(logical seperation in a  server)for your different projects in a server.
pip install virtualenv
u can create packages in any virtual environment wwhich are not conflicted with other venv's.
ssh to server
python -m venv project-abc------create a folder for project-abc
                       xyz
to connect to venv project-abc--------source project-abc/bin/activate------------u can into project-abc
to comeout from the virtual environment project-abc just issue----deactivate               (1h 06min)
IN SIMPLE,VENV'S ARE LIKE NAMESPACES IN KUBERNETES-----------u can create a package and use it for that venv only
virtual environments are used by the devops engineers in realtime more than developers---for creating the requirement of developers.
