Boto3 is used to connect with aws,no need of aws cli,ui etc...
Boto3 is used in serverless(aws lambda)
TO create aws resources like ec2,s3 [go to boto3 docs---search for s3 or ec2 ---check for code(syntax)---in boto3 docs u can search anything and u can.
In boto3.client for an resource(s3 or ec2)----=---here client means resource.(but resource is not supported in future---use boto3.client is recommended)
IN AWS to find list of s3 buckets u need to sign in and aws s3 ls      but using BOTO3 u can dirrectly get the list of buckets very quickly.
Even for TERRAFORMM and CFT U need to sign in.

aws infrastucture like ec2 or s3 etc...are chargable
AWS LAMBDA is serverless,it will create and teardown the infra as per application requirement.
If any ec2 instance is not used since a year OR  ebs (gp2) is not used since 5 months u should notify to the developers regarding them(for cost basis).
So all these factors are considered for cost optimizatio
n because they are automated in aws LAMBDA through a script.That is COST OPTIMIZAZTION using LAMBDA.
CLOUDWATCH is used to to trigger the events for LAMBDA fucntion.

Devops engineer should responsible for cost optimization by identifying the stale(old and unused)resources ,remove them if not required by notifying to edvelopers
through mail(sns).Devops engineer will have access to delete those stale resources that are nolonger required.

COST OPTIMIZATION using delete option-------------------------
Using LAMBDA function----write a python code using a boto3 module(inside python script) that any stale resources are there in aws(ebs or ec2 or s3) to delete them.
Attach LAMBDA function to CLOUDWATCH for event triggered(uploaded object to s3 or ec2 instance created etc..)

1.Identify all the ens snapshots
2.Filterout the stale snapshots.------(And delete them).
