Loops in Python (for and while)
Introduction
Loops are a fundamental concept in programming, and they allow you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. In Python, there are two primary types of loops: "for" and "while."

For Loop
The "for" loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a set of statements for each item in the sequence. The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.

Syntax:

for variable in sequence:
    # Code to be executed for each item in the sequence
REPETETIVE ACTION ON  BLOCK OF CODE----------------

FOR LOOP-----used when u will  know definite number of times to execute the block of code.
WHILE LOOP--used when u dont know (indefinite) how many times to execute.
for variable in sequence :
---
---   block of code------of list, tupple
colours = ["blue","yellow"]
for x in colours:
print x------------o/p is blue and yellow.

WHILE LOOP---------------
while loop is used when u dont know how many times should execute the block of code.It is used based on while condition.
While loop is executed the code until given condition is true.

FOR LOOP MANIPULATION-----
CONTINUE-----------------it contunues by skipping the  given condition
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
for numbers in numbers:
if number = 3:
break
print(number)----------------------------o/p is 1,2-===after break (i.e 3) it wont execute--------
IN CASE OF continue for the code---------o/p is 1,2,4,5.


WHILE LOOP---------
count = 0
while count < 5:
print(count)
count+1-------------------------o/p
