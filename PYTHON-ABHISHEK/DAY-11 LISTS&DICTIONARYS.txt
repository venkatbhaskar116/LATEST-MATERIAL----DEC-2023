Python Real Time UseCase with Dictionaries | Day-11 - Python For DevOps series|-----https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvNU4dupQkg

LISTS  ----in [] (square brackets)----mutable-- (u can change)type wof array
DICTIONARY----IN {}(CURLY brackets)---immutable(u can not change)--values are seperated by :(colan symbol)---using key-value pairs(like name=bachi)
But in LIST just u ill give the characterstics of a person or instance etc...like baba,10 etc..But after some days if user asks u what is 10 u cannot remember.
Whereas in DICTIONARY --u will give all these detailed like
new_dict = {'name': 'bachi','age: 10, 'designation': 'devops engineer'}
Even after somedays if any body asks for details u can simply says as per the key-value pair details in the dictionary.like what is 10,  its an age.
