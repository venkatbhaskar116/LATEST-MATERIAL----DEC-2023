where do you have stored the secrets  ----------
IN jenkins--------credentials or using hashi-corp vault
AWS CODEBUILD-------AWS SECRETS MANAGER.
GITLAB CICD----------------in variable section---we store the secrets and we reference them.

In our organization----the docker image size is very huge and that was also concernig wiwth the security of docker image
    USING the MULTI-STAGE docker build and distroless images we reduce the image size and also we added the security by removing the packages that are installed in the images(
distroless images will do that job).

IN K8S------
some pods are consuming more resources so that restricting the resources and limits in deployment file.so that the pod is restricted with sufficient resources only
If any pod needs more  resources approach the development team and ask them why pod needs more resources and try to solve the problem
Some times application is down u went to the pod and checks the logs.
WWHEN u deploy the application,and u notice that the application went down or unresponsive ----
1.u went to k8s pod and try to access the logs----if it is a java application go to thread dumps and heapdumps and sit wiwth development teamd and solve it.

 
IF DOCKER CONTAINERS ARE RUNNING WITH ROOT    HOW DID YOU MODIFY THEM---------------
