SERVICE MESH----https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0-nWUL1I8g
to avoid all the below challenges---service mesh used

communiction complexity
service discovery 
failure isolation
config changes


previously to communicate with microservices sidecar containers are used.But if microservices and sidecar containers are huge number it wwill be mesh.
TO AVOID WE ARE USING THE SERVICE MESH
IN service mesh---main components---
controlpane--------service mesh control plane,distributes the configuration across the  sidecar proxies in the data plane.
data plane-----instance(under this sidecar)-----instance 2 [under this sidecar]----etc..
so to communicate between the microservices --first request goes to sidecar and trace and observed.
